# Axiom Commercial Licensing Overview

Axiom is free to use under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 for:

- personal projects and learning,
- academic and research work,
- internal non-commercial experimentation.

For **commercial** scenarios — such as:

- embedding Axiom into a paid product or SaaS,
- operating Axiom in production as part of a revenue-generating system,
- offering Axiom-backed services to customers,

you will need a **separate commercial license**.

## Typical Commercial Models

Exact terms will depend on your use-case, but we are open to:

- **Revenue-share** models (percentage of revenue from Axiom-powered features)
- **Usage-based or seat-based** licensing
- **Strategic partnerships** for deeper co-development and research

The goal is to keep Axiom sustainable and evolving, while making it
accessible to teams who want to build serious systems on top of it.
